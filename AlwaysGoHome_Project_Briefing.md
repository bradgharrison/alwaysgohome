# Project Briefing: AlwaysGoHome Chrome Extension

## Project Overview

The "AlwaysGoHome" is a Chrome extension that redirects new tabs to the user's preferred homepage. It's designed to be simple, privacy-focused, and lightweight, following the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid). The project involved multiple development phases including code optimization, UI improvements, git setup, and Chrome Web Store preparation.

## Key Accomplishments

### Permission & Privacy Improvements
- Removed unnecessary tab-related permissions to make the extension more privacy-friendly
- Implemented a new approach using `chrome_url_overrides` and `redirect.js` instead of tab event listeners
- Added a privacy section to README.md highlighting the minimal permissions required
- Verified the extension uses no remote code, enhancing security and store compliance

### UI Enhancements
- Implemented light/dark mode support in both the redirect page and popup UI
- Added CSS variables for consistent theming across components
- Doubled the size of the header icon in the popup window for better visibility
- Simplified the redirect page to show only a loading spinner
- Added support for automatic HTTP/HTTPS protocol selection

### Code Optimization
- Streamlined the codebase by removing unnecessary complexity
- Improved error handling for better robustness
- Simplified background.js by removing redundant message handlers
- Optimized redirect.js by removing excessive try/catch blocks

### Source Control Setup
- Initialized a Git repository for version control
- Created appropriate .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
- Set up GitHub remote repository at https://github.com/bradgharrison/alwaysgohome
- Configured Git with proper user credentials (bradgharrison@gmail.com)
- Successfully pushed the codebase to GitHub's main branch

### Chrome Web Store Preparation
- Created a zip package of the extension for submission
- Added Google site verification file to the repository for store ownership verification
- Corrected license information in README.md (GNU General Public License v3.0)
- Ensured the extension complies with Chrome Web Store policies regarding permissions and remote code

## Technical Details

### File Structure
- manifest.json: Defines extension configuration, permissions, and icons
- background.js: Background service worker managing redirect status
- redirect.html/js: Handles new tab redirection to homepage
- popup.html/js: User interface for setting preferred homepage
- icons/: Contains extension icons (PNG format)

### Key Changes
1. From JPG to PNG icon format in manifest.json
2. Added CSS-based theming with prefers-color-scheme media queries
3. Simplified redirect page to improve performance
4. Optimized JavaScript code for better maintainability
5. Organized repository with proper Git structure

### Current Status
The extension is prepared for Chrome Web Store submission with:
- All necessary files properly packaged
- Minimal required permissions (storage only and host_permissions for redirection)
- Modern UI with light/dark mode support
- GitHub repository for source control
- Google site verification prepared for store listing

## Version 2.0 Updates

### Tab Management Improvements
- Added "Maintain single homepage tab" feature to prevent duplicate homepage tabs
- Created homepage tab tracking system in background.js to monitor the active homepage tab
- Implemented tab focusing system to reuse existing homepage tab instead of opening new tabs
- Added automatic URL reset functionality to restore the homepage if navigated away from

### Link Handling Enhancements
- Added smart link interception for links that would normally open in new tabs
- Implemented window.open approach to open links in new windows rather than new tabs
- Enhanced content script to detect and handle link clicks on the homepage
- Used special URL marker (#alwaysGoHomeSameTab) to identify and track homepage tabs

### Code Architecture Improvements
- Added robust logging system for easier troubleshooting and debugging
- Implemented communication system between background script and content script
- Enhanced error handling to gracefully recover from unexpected conditions
- Added tab status verification to ensure homepage tab remains on correct URL
- Created a unified approach to URL formatting and checking

### Permission Updates
- Added "tabs" permission to enable more sophisticated tab management capabilities
- Enhanced security model to maintain privacy while enabling new tab management features
- Implemented permission-aware design to minimize impact on user privacy

### UI and UX Enhancements
- Updated popup.html with new checkbox option for the single tab feature
- Improved description text to clearly explain new functionality
- Enhanced the redirect flow for better user experience
- Improved new tab detection and handling

### Technical Advancements
- Implemented advanced tab lifecycle management
- Added browser startup detection to handle the first tab opened when Chrome launches
- Created a tab hijacking system for the initial Chrome startup tab
- Developed a robust tab-closing mechanism that works reliably across browser sessions

## Version 2.1 Updates

### Focus Management Improvements
- Enhanced tab focus handling to ensure proper keyboard focus after redirection
- Added robust focus system that properly focuses on the search input when available
- Implemented messaging between background script and content script for reliable focus control
- Fixed issue where users couldn't immediately type after tab redirection
- Added `focusOnLoad` URL parameter to trigger proper focus behavior after page loading

### Code Refinements
- Added delay handling to ensure focus is set after navigation completes
- Enhanced error handling for focus-related operations
- Improved focus management across all script components (background, content, redirect)
- Implemented consistent focus handling for all tab management scenarios

### General Improvements
- Improved validation to prevent tab manipulation when no homepage is set
- Enhanced the homepage tab verification system
- Streamlined debugging code while maintaining core functionality
- Fixed edge cases in tab opening and focus behavior

---

This project successfully transformed a basic Chrome extension into a polished, privacy-focused tool ready for distribution, following best practices for both code quality and user experience. Version 2.1 significantly enhances the user experience by providing robust focus management, ensuring users can immediately start typing after tab redirection or focusing.
