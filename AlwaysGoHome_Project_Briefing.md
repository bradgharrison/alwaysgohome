# Project Briefing: AlwaysGoHome Chrome Extension

## Project Overview

The "AlwaysGoHome" is a Chrome extension that redirects new tabs to the user's preferred homepage. It's designed to be simple, privacy-focused, and lightweight, following the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid). The project involved multiple development phases including code optimization, UI improvements, git setup, and Chrome Web Store preparation.

## Key Accomplishments

### Permission & Privacy Improvements
- Removed unnecessary tab-related permissions to make the extension more privacy-friendly
- Implemented a new approach using `chrome_url_overrides` and `redirect.js` instead of tab event listeners
- Added a privacy section to README.md highlighting the minimal permissions required
- Verified the extension uses no remote code, enhancing security and store compliance

### UI Enhancements
- Implemented light/dark mode support in both the redirect page and popup UI
- Added CSS variables for consistent theming across components
- Doubled the size of the header icon in the popup window for better visibility
- Simplified the redirect page to show only a loading spinner
- Added support for automatic HTTP/HTTPS protocol selection

### Code Optimization
- Streamlined the codebase by removing unnecessary complexity
- Improved error handling for better robustness
- Simplified background.js by removing redundant message handlers
- Optimized redirect.js by removing excessive try/catch blocks

### Source Control Setup
- Initialized a Git repository for version control
- Created appropriate .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
- Set up GitHub remote repository at https://github.com/bradgharrison/alwaysgohome
- Configured Git with proper user credentials (bradgharrison@gmail.com)
- Successfully pushed the codebase to GitHub's main branch

### Chrome Web Store Preparation
- Created a zip package of the extension for submission
- Added Google site verification file to the repository for store ownership verification
- Corrected license information in README.md (GNU General Public License v3.0)
- Ensured the extension complies with Chrome Web Store policies regarding permissions and remote code

## Technical Details

### File Structure
- manifest.json: Defines extension configuration, permissions, and icons
- background.js: Background service worker managing redirect status
- redirect.html/js: Handles new tab redirection to homepage
- popup.html/js: User interface for setting preferred homepage
- icons/: Contains extension icons (PNG format)

### Key Changes
1. From JPG to PNG icon format in manifest.json
2. Added CSS-based theming with prefers-color-scheme media queries
3. Simplified redirect page to improve performance
4. Optimized JavaScript code for better maintainability
5. Organized repository with proper Git structure

### Current Status
The extension is prepared for Chrome Web Store submission with:
- All necessary files properly packaged
- Minimal required permissions (storage only and host_permissions for redirection)
- Modern UI with light/dark mode support
- GitHub repository for source control
- Google site verification prepared for store listing

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. Complete Chrome Web Store submission using the prepared ZIP file
2. Consider adding automated testing to ensure functionality across Chrome versions
3. Monitor user feedback after launch for potential improvements
4. Consider expanding to other browsers (Firefox, Edge) if there's interest
5. Ensure regular updates to maintain compatibility with Chrome changes
